This release introduces a new feature: [**remote orphan detection**](https://github.com/vladistan/repo-find-orphans/tree/v0.1.1?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-remote-orphans).  Now you can use `repo-find-orphans` to find repositories on GitHub that are not included in your repo manifest. This is useful for discovering repositories where you collaborate but are not monitored by your repo project.


**Breaking Changes:**

The version 0.1.1 introduces breaking changes to the CLI interface, see [documentation](https://github.com/vladistan/repo-find-orphans/tree/v0.1.1?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for details.

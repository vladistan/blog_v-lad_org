I just put a quick transform script to convert outlines generated by [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) to MarkDown slide deck. The markdown is specific to [Wiki2Beamer](https://github.com/vladistan/wiki2beamer) flavor.

Here the script code is here.

It is not the best of the XQuery code, but it does the job.
